In 2020, the Russian Football Union (RFU) launched a digital platform developed in collaboration with **Gost Group**, based on the domestic software **GOST Platform**.  
The projectâ€™s goal is the **digitalization of the football industry** and the transition to electronic interaction between all participants.

This project was landmark for our product **Soarse** â€” it was not only the **first implementation**, but also laid the architectural principles we followed in further projects.

### ðŸ“¦ WEB-based DBMS

All data, including **master data**, **operations**, and **transactions** (such as fitness test results, match outcomes, etc.), is stored directly in Soarse.

Feature:  
The client-side of the product **serves as a DBAâ€™s workplace** â€” the user doesnâ€™t just manage forms, but directly works with the data structure.

### ðŸ”— REST API and Hybrid Architecture

The portal part of the system was developed by another team, which became a flexibility test for our API.  
As a result:

- We **refined the hybrid implementation model**
- All functions are available via **REST requests**
- Backend and frontend interfaces were completely decoupled

### ðŸ“Š Report Generator

For some complex screen forms, we had to develop **JOIN controllers**.  
This experience formed the basis of the **views and aggregates** architecture, which later became an integral part of Soarse.

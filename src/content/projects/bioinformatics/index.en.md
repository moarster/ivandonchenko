My first serious experience in **computational biology**, where I got hands-on with both software development and biological data analysis.  
As part of the curriculum at the Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Moscow State University, I independently developed a student website and solved a wide range of **bioinformatics tasks**, including:

- DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis,
- multiple sequence alignment,
- phylogenetic tree construction,
- working with biological databases (GenBank, UniProt, PDB),
- protein structure prediction,
- genome annotation,
- mining and parsing biomedical data.

The project involved **Java** and **Perl** scripting for bioinformatics pipelines, parsers, and data transformation, along with HTML/CSS for the frontend.  
This was a fully hands-on experience where I had to:

- design the structure and UI of the student website;
- write backend logic using Perl/CGI;
- parse FASTA files and BLAST outputs;
- integrate third-party biological resources;
- visualize analytical results.

> Throughout my professional journey, I've worn many hats. Starting as a developer, I progressed to team lead, project manager, and eventually headed an entire department. When my work began lacking creative fulfillment, I returned to my roots â€” first as a business architect and product owner, then fully immersing myself in code as a systems architect.

## ðŸ’° Professional Experience

Over twelve years in the IT industry, I've acquired diverse skills:

- **Development** in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript (React+Node), Python
- Designing and administering **databases**: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB
- **Managing** government and commercial projects
- Gathering and analyzing client **requirements**
- Formalizing **business processes**, automating and orchestrating them in BPM engines
- Creating user **interfaces** and prototypes
- Designing software **architecture**

## ðŸ§¬ Education

From 2004 to 2011, I studied at the Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University. While I didn't complete my degree due to personal circumstances, I finished all academic requirements through the 5th year.  
At university, I mastered Java, Perl, SQL, improved my English, gained scientific research experience, and developed expertise in data processing algorithms, machine learning, and neural networks.  
I maintain a strong interest in text analysis, pattern recognition, and extracting meaning from complex data.

## ðŸ“– Areas of Interest

Outside of work, I'm passionate about:

- Quantum physics and cosmology
- Biology and medicine
- Cinema and video games
- Clinical psychology and psychiatry
- Energy and engineering
- Urban planning and transportation infrastructure
- Global politics and macroeconomics
- Sociology and linguistics

## ðŸªš Hobbies

### Handyman

I'm skilled in electrical work and plumbing, have participated in house construction, but my true love is woodworking. Transforming raw wood into something useful gives me the same satisfaction as writing perfect code.

### Avid Cyclist

To me, a bicycle isn't just sports equipment â€” it's a versatile means of transportation and an extension of my physical capabilities.

### Cinephile

I can enthusiastically discuss Lars von Trier's oeuvre or cinematic trends of the past decade.

### Casual Gamer

I enjoy economic simulators, city-building strategies, and interactive movies, though I rarely play â€” maybe once every few months.

### Passionate Cook

I believe cooking is a creative process, and a man at the stove is a captivating sight.

### Frequent Traveler

Before the pandemic, I traveled regularly, visiting Europe and America at least four times a year.
